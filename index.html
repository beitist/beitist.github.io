        <p>My time stretches between family, work, garden and learning. 
          I wouldn't wanna miss out on most if not all - so understanding 
          how much time I spend on learning what can quickly become fuzzy and - 
          in hindsight - not very useful to know and tell. So I'll try to recap 
          my learning time and list it here on weekly basis, to get a better 
          understanding of the idea of "developer in a year".</p>
        <p>... having tried and deleted a list of what I went through last week, I must
          admit I do have notes but not a solid grasp on my time spent. So I'll
          just take my calendar and estimate my time spent so far learning 
          coding and everything related to that. Given that today is day 25 since I started,
        and there were a few holidays, I'd estimate that I have spent 50 hours since March 29, 2021.</p>
          <p>All in all, I have done the following since the week before Easter:
            <ul>
              <li>Enrolled in a commercial self-paced JavaScript course - so far I've done
                about 40% of the contents which cover: basics, arrays, objects, DOM manipulation.
              </li>
              <li>I had done some HTML about 20 years back, but never pursued that path in my life.
                While working on my course, I pick up the occasional HTML and CSS.
              </li>
              <li>I went through FreeCodeCamp's web designer course (HTML + CSS), although I did this
                last year while I was unemployed for a month and I don't remember much of it.
              </li>
              <li>
                I've read half of "clean code" and I understood about 95% so far!! Yes!
              </li>
              <li>I realised that I had a git-account which was totally unused, so I started
                using git. Great software.
              </li>
              <li>I have helped a few people on freecodecamp with challenges they faced.</li>
              <li>I have started programming a simple card game as a learning project. You can find all
                about it <a href='https://github.com/beitist/simple-mau-mau'>here</a>!
              </li>
            </ul>

    <p>So nice of you to be here!</p>
