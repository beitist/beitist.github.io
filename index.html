    <div class='entry-text'>Hi everyone, my name is Sebastian. I have decided to take up the challenge and learn to code. Why?
      My mind has a million ideas about what to do with a computer, and I need tools to make them work. :-) I am a teacher in life,
      and who knows... maybe programming becomes a career option later. Here, I am collecting my daily amount of work in order to get
      a better understanding about the effort it takes to become a coder.

        <p>Another day in the neighbourhood... I've been doing some garden work - laying the surrounding bricks for our terrace,
          which is good and necessary. Also repotted some plants and sewed a few herbs. Then I went to see my brother for about
          an hour to chat about mobile homes and the like - we are thinking of getting one, and he has lots of experience
          with vans and similar cars!
        </p>
        <p>So coming back to the coding: I was browsing the net yesterday and came across some good resources that I'd like to share. One is a
          coding challenge vor beginners, the other an introduction on how to contribute to open-source projects on github. I am particularly interested
          in the latter, as I'm frequently using open-source projects, and it is time to give back! I will definitively post about my experience using both websites! :-) Check out the links
          yourself.
          <ul>
            <li><a href='https://codenewbie.com'>Code Newbie</a> (with frequent challenges): a forum with some extras for beginning programmers</li>
            <li><a href='https://www.firsttimersonly.com/'>FirstTimers Only</a>: an intro to github and what you can contribute as a first-timer</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>What I've done today:
          <ul>
            <li>EventHandlers: Spent about 20min reading about them.</li>
            <li>45min of coding on my game project</li>
            <li>30min of helping out at <a href='https://forum.freecodecamp.org'>Freecodecamp Forum</a></li>
            <li>about 3 hours of coding on my game project, until I decided to start over :-)</li>
            <li>spent 15min reading on Model-View-Controller (MVC) design</li>
            <li>about 30min re-coding my game project</li>
            <li>about 30min coding a new project to better understand the MVC</li>
          </ul>
          Adding it all up sums up to 5:50 today. I'll log it...

        <p>My time stretches between family, work, garden and learning. 
          I wouldn't wanna miss out on most if not all - so understanding 
          how much time I spend on learning what can quickly become fuzzy and - 
          in hindsight - not very useful to know and tell. So I'll try to recap 
          my learning time and list it here on weekly basis, to get a better 
          understanding of the idea of "developer in a year".</p>
        <p>... having tried and deleted a list of what I went through last week, I must
          admit I do have notes but not a solid grasp on my time spent. So I'll
          just take my calendar and estimate my time spent so far learning 
          coding and everything related to that. Given that today is day 25 since I started,
        and there were a few holidays, I'd estimate that I have spent 60 hours since March 29, 2021.</p>
          <p>All in all, I have done the following since the week before Easter:
            <ul>
              <li>Enrolled in a commercial self-paced JavaScript course - so far I've done
                about 40% of the contents which cover: basics, arrays, objects, DOM manipulation.
              </li>
              <li>I had done some HTML about 20 years back, but never pursued that path in my life.
                While working on my course, I pick up the occasional HTML and CSS.
              </li>
              <li>I went through FreeCodeCamp's web designer course (HTML + CSS), although I did this
                last year while I was unemployed for a month and I don't remember much of it. I estimate
                that I spent about 30 hours on it, as I do remember designing some graphics to make the 
                project sites look nicer.
              </li>
              <li>
                I've read half of "clean code" and I understood about 95% so far!! Yes!
              </li>
              <li>I realised that I had a git-account which was totally unused, so I started
                using git. Great software.
              </li>
              <li>I have helped a few people on freecodecamp with challenges they faced.</li>
              <li>I have started programming a simple card game as a learning project. You can find all
                about it <a href='https://github.com/beitist/simple-mau-mau'>here</a>!
              </li>
            </ul>
            So let's estimate that I have spent 90 hours of learning including today!

    <p>So nice of you to be here!</p>
